					<h2>Trauma & Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) Education</h2>
					<p>Adverse experiences have the potential to be present in the lives of any individual regardless of one's age, race or culture due to the actions of oneself, or others. Traumatic experiences negatively impact those who have been exposed to negative experiences, but with support services providing education, prevention, intervention and therapeutic services the effects of those experiences can be reduced and emotional well-being can be achieved.</p>
					<p>This workshop is designed for Parents/Caregivers and educators to increase their knowledge about the signs and symptoms of trauma, how their actions or in-actions influence those who have experienced adverse experiences and be pro-active in minimizing continued negative outcomes. Participants will learn what trauma and adverse childhood experiences are, the causes and symptoms of ACE's, the short and long term impact, the impact on parenting personality and temperament characteristics and healthy coping strategies with interventions and community support services.</p>
